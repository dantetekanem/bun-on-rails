<h1>About Bun on Rails</h1>

<p>Bun on Rails is a lightweight, Rails-inspired framework designed for Bun. It follows the philosophy of convention over configuration, allowing developers to focus on their application logic rather than boilerplate code.</p>

<h2>Design Philosophy</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Convention Over Configuration:</strong> Models are auto-loaded, routes can be inferred from file structure, and the database schema is introspected automatically.</li>
  <li><strong>Declarative API:</strong> Everything is defined inside the class body, with minimal boilerplate.</li>
  <li><strong>Automatic Initialization:</strong> Classes self-register when imported, avoiding explicit setup calls.</li>
</ul>
